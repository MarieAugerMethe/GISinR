# GIS in R
Presentations, Tutorials, and Assignments associated with the graduate module that I (Marie Auger-Methe) am teaching at Dalhousie. This mini graduate class focusses on methods to handle and visualise spatial data in R.

Some of the data used are public data sets from the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) and can be found on the OTN website: http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/. In particular, 
- sableSealBioP.csv and sableSealBioP.kml are the “Animal” files from the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SGS.htm)
- nbCod.csv is the “Animal” files from the Shippagan, NB: Cod tagging project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SPI.htm)


Note that I have removed and changed some of the information from these datasets, just to create good examples for teaching purposes.
