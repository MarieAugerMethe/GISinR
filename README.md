# GIS in R

Presentations, Tutorials, and Assignments associated with the graduate module that I (Marie Auger-Methe) am teaching at Dalhousie. This mini graduate class focusses on methods to handle and visualise spatial data in R.

Some data come from the Natural Earth website (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). In particular: borders.shp, mainRivers.shp, smallRivers.shp. These are all 10m layers. Note that I have croped the data to the extent relevant to the analyses.

Some data used are from public data sets from the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) and can be found on the OTN website: http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/. In particular, 
- sableSealBioP.csv is based on the “Animal” file from the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SGS.htm)
- nbCod.csv is based on the “Animal” file from the Shippagan, NB: Cod tagging project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SPI.htm)
- kintama.csv is based on the "Animal" file from the OTN Kintama 2004-2011 tags project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/KNTM.htm). Original file is available at: members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/bypublic.htm#K

Some data used are from public data sets from the OTN Ocean Gliders and Marine Observation website: http://gliders.oceantrack.org/. In particular,
- waveglider.csv is based on the wg_m42_waveglider.csv (http://gliders.oceantrack.org/ajax/waveglider/) 

Finally, I am using OTN data that is not part of the public datasets. In particular, 
- Seal3_169_2_01_1.csv is some of the tracks published in: 
  Lidgard DC, Bowen WD, Jonsen ID, Iverson SJ (2014) Predator-borne acoustic transceivers and GPS tracking reveal spatial and temporal patterns of encounters with acoustically-tagged fish in the open ocean. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 501:157-168. 
  These are tracks associated with the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SGS.htm). Please contact authors for more information or for any other use of the data.

Notes:

- Note that I have removed and changed some of the information from these datasets, just to create good examples for teaching purposes.

- Note that these datasets are posted online along these tutorials for educational purposes only and not for research.

- Go to the OTN website (http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/) for more information and to get the datasets in their untampered versions.

- Go to the Natural Earth website (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) for the original data.
