# GIS in R

Presentations, Tutorials, and Assignments associated with the graduate module that I (Marie Auger-Methe) am teaching at Dalhousie. This mini graduate class focusses on methods to handle and visualise spatial data in R.

Some of the data come from the Natural Earth website (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). Note that I have crop the data to the extent relevant to analyses. In particular: borders.shp, mainRivers.shp, smallRivers.shp. These are all 10m layers.

Some of the data used are public data sets from the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) and can be found on the OTN website: http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/. In particular, 
- sableSealBioP.csv and sableSealBioP.kml are based on the “Animal” files from the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SGS.htm)
- nbCod.csv is based on the “Animal” files from the Shippagan, NB: Cod tagging project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SPI.htm)
- kintama.csv is based on the "Animal" file from the OTN Kintama 2004-2011 tags project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/KNTM.htm). Original file is available at: members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/bypublic.htm#K

In addition some of the data was taken from the public data from OTN Ocean Gliders and Marine Observation website: http://gliders.oceantrack.org/. In particular,
- waveglider.csv is based on the wg_m42_waveglider.csv (http://gliders.oceantrack.org/ajax/waveglider/) 

Finally, I am using OTN data that is not part of the public datasets. In particular, 
- Seal3_169_2_01_1.csv is some of the tracks published in: 
  Lidgard DC, Bowen WD, Jonsen ID, Iverson SJ (2014) Predator-borne acoustic transceivers and GPS tracking reveal spatial and temporal patterns of encounters with acoustically-tagged fish in the open ocean. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 501:157-168. 
  These are tracks associated with the OTN Canada Sable Island Grey Seal Bioprobes project (http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/SGS.htm). Please contact authors for more information or for any other use of the data.

Notes:

- Note that I have removed and changed some of the information from these datasets, just to create good examples for teaching purposes.

- Note that these datasets are posted online along these tutorials for educational purposes only and not for research.

- Go to the Ocean Tracking Network webpage (http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/) for more information. You can get some of the datasets in their untampered version on the OTN website.

- Go to the Natural Earth website (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) for the original data.
